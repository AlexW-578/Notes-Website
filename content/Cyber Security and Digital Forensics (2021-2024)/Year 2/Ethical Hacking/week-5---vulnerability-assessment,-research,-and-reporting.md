## OSI Model

### Application, Layer 7

- Access Control
- Authentication
- Malware
- Software Vulnerabilities

### Presentation, Layer 6

- Format
- encoding
  - e.g. unicode vulnerabilities

### Session, Layer 5

- Cookies
- authentication

### Transport, Layer 4

- Replay Attacks
- TCP Attacks
- SSL/TLS
- encryption

### Network, Layer 3

- Routing protocols
- VPN
- IP Spoofing
- Firewalls

### Datalink, Layer 2

- MAC Spoofing
- ARP

### Physical, Layer 1

- Physical security
- Locks
- Cables
- Wireless
- Biometrics

## Locations of Assessments

### Human

- Human Errors
- Insider threat
- social engineering
- indifference

### Application

- Functions
- storage
- memory management
- input validation

### Host

- Access Control
- memory
- malware
- backdoor
- OS/Kernel

### Network

- Map the network
- Services
- Leaks
- Intercept Traffic

## Types of Penetration Testing

### Black Box

- Zero Knowledge
- Testing as Attacker

### Grey Box

- Some Knowledge
- Testing as User with access to some data

### White Box

- Full Knowledge
- Testing as Developer

## Stages of Engagement

1. Asset Discovery
2. Asset Prioritisation
3. Vulnerability Scanning
4. Result analysis & remediation
5. Continuos Security

### Pre-Engagement

- Understand the scope
- What are the objectives
- Understanding priorities

### Asset Discovery

- White Box Testing
  - Access to the network/Site Management
  - Knowledge of resources
- Passive Means
  - Google Dorking
  - Shodan
  - OSINT
  - Threat Intelligence
- Active Means
  - Port Scans
  - Web Crawling
- Social Engineering and Phishing

### Asset Prioritisation

- Sorting the risk and impact of resources
- Sorting vulnerabilities by the level of weakness

### Vulnerability Identification

- How is the data stored?
  - Memory
  - Database
  - File
  - Cloud
  - Access Control
  - People
- How is data processed?
  - Computer architecture
  - Memory
  - Applications
  - People
- How is data Transmitted?
  - Encryption
  - Medium
  - Protocols
  - People

#### Manual Identification

- Is User input trusted?
  - Find injection points
    - Web input
    - network packets
      - e.g. CVE-2019-3568
  - Fuzzing
  - Testing
  - Exploit
- Common Pitfalls
  - Common Errors & Vulnerabilities
  - Default configurations
  - Exposed data and credentials
- Source Code
  - Bugs
  - Reverse Engineer
- Protocol Analysis
- Fuzzing
- Enumeration
  - Hostnames
  - Passwords
  - Directories
  - Services
- Stress Testing

#### Vulnerability Scanning

- Essentially Port and Directory Scans
- Banner Grabbing
- Identifying services
- Checking for confidential files
- Misconfigurations
- Attempts subtle testing
- Checks identified version of softeare and services against vulnerability databases

##### Types of Vulnerability Assessemnt Scans

- Network-Based Scans
  - Identifies possible network security attacks and vulnerable systems on networks
- Host-Based Scans
  - Finds vulnerabilities in workstations, servers, or other network hosts, and provides visibility into configuration settings and patch history
- Wireless Scans
  - Identifies rogue access points and validate that a company's network is securely configured
- Application Scans
  - Detects known software vulnerabilities and mis-configurations in network or web apps
- Database Scans
  - Identifies the weak points in a database

**Scanners:**
- Nikto
- Nmap
- OpenVAS
- Metasploit
- OWASP ZAP Scanner
- Nexpose
- Nessus
- Qualys
- Tenable
