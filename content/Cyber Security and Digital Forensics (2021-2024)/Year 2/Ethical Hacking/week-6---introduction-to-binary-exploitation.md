**Never Trust User Input!**

## Where do we conduct assessments?

- Human
  - Human errors
  - Insider threat
  - Social engineering
  - Indifference
- Application <- This is what binary exploitation exploits
  - Functions
  - Storage
  - Memory Management
  - Input validation
- Host
  - Access control
  - Memory
  - Malware
  - Backdoor
  - OS/Kernel
- Network
  - Map the network
  - Services
  - Leaks
  - Intercept Traffic

## Finding Files

Commands:

- find - Search for files in a directory
- locate - Find Files by name, quickly
- which - locate a command

Finding SUID Files:

`find / -perm -4000` or `find / -perm -u=s -type f`

Finding SGUID Files:

`find / -perm -2000` or `find / -perm -g=s -type f`

Finding SUID + SGID:

`find / -perm -6000` or `find / -perm -u+g=s -type f`

## Tools that can be used

Read files:

- cat
- strings
- xxd

Manipulate files:

- vi

Compilation for C Programs:

- gcc
- gcc-multilib

Read Binary File Objects/Locations:

- objdump
- dmesg

Read Memory:

- gdb
- gdb-peda

Exploit Development:

- python3
- Any Programming language really

## What is a binary file?

- Sequential bytes
- Instructions/Code
- Data
- EXE - Windows
- ELF - Linux
- 32-bits - 4 bytes
- 64-bits - 8 bytes

## Memory

When a program is executed it is loaded into memory.

- Registers
  - Quickly accessible location on the computer's processor
- Code
- Stack
- Heap

### Registers

Size:

- 8 bit
- 32 bit
- 64 bit

Types:

- General
  - Data
  - Pointers
  - Index
- Control
- Segment
