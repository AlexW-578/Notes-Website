# Basic Numeracy & Basic Algebra
## Negative numbers
### Subtracting
Subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding a positive number
#### *e.g.*
- 2-(-5)=2+5=7

### Multiplying / Dividing
#### Same Sign
The result of multiplying/dividing two numbers of the same sign is always positive.
##### *e.g.* 
- (-10)/(-2)=5
- 2\*3=6
- (-4)\*(-4)=8
- -4/-2=2

#### Different Signs
The result of multiplying/dividing two numbers of the opposing signs is always negative.
##### *e.g.*
- 2\*(-3)=-6
- (-2)\*4=-8
- 4/(-2)=-2

## BIDMAS
### Order of operation:
	First = Brackets 
	Second = Indices 
	Third = Division
	Third = Multiplication
	Fourth = Addition
	Fourth = Subtraction



## Fractions
### Equivalent Fractions
Fraction = Numerator / Denominator = p/q

Equivalent Fractions can be expressed in a different form, but always have the same value.

Multiplying or dividing both the numerator and denominator by the same number produces an equivalent fraction.

#### *e.g.*
- 1/2 = 2/4 = 4/8 = 8/16
- 1/2 = 1\*2/2\*2 = 2/4


### Addition / Subtraction of Fractions
1. Rewrite each fraction so they have the same denominator.
2. Calculate the sum/difference of the numerators
3. Simplify

#### *e.g.*
1. 3/10 + 1/4 = 6/20 + 5/20
2. 5/20 + 5/20 = 11/20
3. 3/10 + 1/4 = 11/20

### Multiplication of fractions
1. Numerator of the result -> Multiply the numerators
	Denominator of the result -> Multiply the denominators
2. Simplify
#### *e.g.*
- 3/10 \* 5/8 = (3\*5)/(10\*8) = 15/80

### Division of fractions
1. Multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction (invert the fraction)
2. Simplify

#### *e.g.*
- 3/10 / 5/8 = 3/10 \* 8/5 = 24/50 = 12/25

### Simplest form of fractions
This is when there is no factors other than 1 common to both the numerator and denominator

#### *e.g.*
- 24/32 = 12/18 = 4/6 = 2/3

## Algebra
- Term = A Term is either a dingle number or variable or the product of several numbers and/or variables *e.g. 2 , 3y , 4yz<sup>2</sup> *
- Constant = A Term without a symbol

### Multiplying algebraic expression
- Multiply the numbers and multiply the variables

#### *e.g.*
- 2(-3b) = -6b
- (4xy)(-2xy) = -8x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>2</sup>

### Expanding Brackets
